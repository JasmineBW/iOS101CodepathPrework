## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Applications I Like
- Craft
	- I like the layout of the app which is simple in a modern way
	- I like how I can create 'spaces' for my different types of writing
- Slack
	- I like how it makes communication with teams super easy
	- I like the simplistic and easy layout
- Parallel
	- I like that it allows me to run Windows applications on my MAC
	- I like that it has an affordable pricing for students

Application I'd Create
I've loved books for a while, and while I can't read as much as I used to because of school, I would love an app that makes reading that connects me to other readers. It would be
combining Wattpad's best feature, which is community, with ebook reader platforms, so rather than having to read just fanfics and 'unpublished' books on Wattpad, readers can 
read published books and share their comments on specific lines or paragraphs/sections. Each comment would have a validation period, to keep the app safe and prevent spoilers, and comments can be liked and upvoted. I'm yet to find an app which brings a safe, in-book community to readers and that's what this app does.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a slight bump trying to navigate the Xcode interface
